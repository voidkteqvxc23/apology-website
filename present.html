<h2 style="color: black; border-bottom: 3px solid black; padding-bottom: 8px margin-top 8px;"><i>This is where we'll end up the the future my sweet baby</i></h2>

<h3><p>I know we had a lot of ups and downs I had a lot of issues but I promise I'm changing for you my sweet baby because I love you so much.
<br>I didn't come into your life for us to just break up after months of having a relationship. I came into your life to stay permanently.
<br>So I wanna prove to you that a man like me can change for the person he loves the most. Because I want you to be my end game.
<br>Because I already told you repeatedly, You're all I want in this life and the next and even in other universes.

<br><br> I love you so much baby kate
